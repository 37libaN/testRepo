"A Poem" by anonymous

12 times flipping an hour glass
And green apples just don’t turn red
I mean, how do you attack a shadow?
Lay down or turn out the lights I guess
Drift night to night
Except it’s more of the same
Future’s looking good as I’m looking out
Only a treadmill is a poor excuse for a marathon
